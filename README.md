# Python-Capstone-JCDS2204

I made This simple Python program for a Data Science program I am currently enrolling in. I based this program on one of my favorite games, Stardew Valley by making an inventory program for Pierre's General Store in the game that includes the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionalities. 

It's not entirely accurate to the game to prevent there being too much data that is necessary. 

Thank you :)<3
